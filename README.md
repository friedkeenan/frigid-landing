# Frigid Landing

Upgrade ice blocks by falling on them from a great enough height!

***

If an entity wearing frost walker boots falls 10 or more blocks onto an ice block (normal or packed), there is a chance that the ice block will be upgraded to the next tier of ice (a higher chance for a higher level of frost walker).
